**Overview**

This repository contains projects and tools for Linguistic Analysis, focusing on extracting, analyzing, and visualizing language patterns, structures, and semantics from textual data. It combines natural language processing (NLP) techniques and statistical methods to gain insights into linguistic phenomena.

**Key objectives include:**

- Exploring language structures like syntax, semantics, and morphology.
- Analyzing word frequencies, n-grams, sentiment, and topic modeling.
- Visualizing linguistic data for better understanding and interpretation.

**Key Features**

**Text Preprocessing:**

- Tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, and part-of-speech (POS) tagging.

**Statistical Analysis:**

- Word frequency analysis, n-grams, TF-IDF computation, and Zipfâ€™s law validation.

**Linguistic Models:**

- Sentiment analysis using lexicon-based and machine learning models.
- Topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- Dependency parsing and syntax tree analysis.

**Visualization:**

- Word clouds, co-occurrence networks, and topic visualizations.
